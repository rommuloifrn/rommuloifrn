## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, pal.

I am a software development brazillian student interested in back-end, 3D and linux. Here, you will find some exercises i solved from courses and from college subjects, also a little of my projects, most of them in portuguese with variable names in english.
- :hammer_and_wrench: Today i develop mostly in Django. I have a [little project](https://mmineriosrn.pythonanywhere.com) (a "stocktaking" app to a [mineral museum](https://www.instagram.com/museudemineriosifrn/)) on it.
- ðŸ“š I have been studying Java, with the prospect of progressing to Spring Boot soon.
